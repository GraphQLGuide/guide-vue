# Changelog
All notable changes will be documented in this file.

This file applies to the app that is created in Chapter 7 of the book—so the numbered step branches, not `master` ([more info](https://github.com/GraphQLGuide/guide-vue/blob/master/README.md)).

Releases are done with tags in the form `[step]_[version]`, so for instance step `2` of version `1.0.0` is `2_1.0.0`, located here: 

[/GraphQLGuide/guide/releases/tag/2_1.0.0](https://github.com/GraphQLGuide/guide/releases/tag/2_1.0.0)
