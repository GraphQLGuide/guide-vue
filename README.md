## Chapter 7: Vue

Numbered branches (`0` and up) have the most up-to-date code (often newer than the most recent published revision of the book). When code has changed between book revisions, a new code version is created, and each branch is tagged, with the naming format `[step]_[version]`. For instance, revision `r6` of the book was published with version `1.0.0` of this repo, so the tag for step 2 was [`2_1.0.0`](https://github.com/GraphQLGuide/guide-vue/releases/tag/2_1.0.0).

## Supporting

Thank you to everyone who has contributed 😃🙌

## Contributing

We welcome issues and PRs! For large changes, we recommend opening an issue first to get feedback before putting in the work of a PR. Minor things like typo fixes can go directly to PRs and will usually get a quick response 😊

When editing code that's part of the book, submit the PR to the corresponding step branch (eg branch `3` for step 3) instead of to `master`.
